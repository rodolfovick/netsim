# netsim
PCAP network simulator. The idea is to send a PCAP file on a choose interface.
Using a network capture file (using tcpdump or wireshark for example), you can simulate any network.

## Roadmap

What's working:

- Simple console-based interface
- Endless loop transmission
- Support to traditional PCAP file format
- Time interval between packets are honored

To do:

- Support to the others PCAP formats
- Transmission separated from user interface
- Counter, counters and more counters
